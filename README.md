This repository contains the source code for Flutter plugins that are
developed by Google but not by the core Flutter team.
Check the `packages` directory for all plugins.

Flutter plugins enable access to platform-specific APIs. For more information
about plugins, and how to use them, see
[https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/).

These plugins are also available on
[pub](https://pub.dartlang.org/flutter/plugins).

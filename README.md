# Flutter plugins

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/google/flutter.plugins.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/google/flutter.plugins)

This repository contains the source code for Flutter plugins that are
developed by Google but not by the core Flutter team.
Check the `packages` directory for all plugins.

Flutter plugins enable access to platform-specific APIs. For more information
about plugins, and how to use them, see

These plugins are also available on
[pub](https://pub.dartlang.org/flutter/plugins).
